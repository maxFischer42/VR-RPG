  description: "As you enter the church you see that the roof of the chapel has rotted
    away giving a clear view of the ever enduring midnight sky. A few benches still
    remain along with a pulpit. This place seems to give an aura of safety especially
    to the common traveler. To the north there\u2019s a wooden door behind the pulpit.
    Engraved in the pulpit it reads \u201CEvery Sunday, the skeleton plays his organ
    for the congregation.\u201D "
